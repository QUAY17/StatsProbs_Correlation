Calculus based Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists

Correlation: when analyzing relationships between two or more random variables, the concept of correlation is important.
The theoretical correlation is computed using ρ = Cov(X,Y)√V(X)V(Y)=E(XY)−E(X)E(Y)/σXσY

The sample correlation is found when replacing the expected values by averages, that is r=∑ni=1 (XiYi)/n−X·Y/√(∑X2i/n−X2)(∑Y2i/n−Y2)

Naturally, we would expect, when the sample is large enough, that the samplevcorrelation r will be close to the expected one, ρ.
